# COMMAND-LINE INTERFACE (CLI)

A command-line interface ([CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)) is a means of interacting with a computer program by inputting lines of text called _command-lines_. 

The command line dropped in popularity following the introduction of [GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) - based personal computer Operating Systems like Microsoft, Windows, and Apple's "classic" Mac OS in the *1980*s. The command line remains an important tool for IT professionals, software developers, sys admins, network administrators and many others who prefer a more precise and reproduceable interface to their systems.

> To sum it up, CLI is a text-based user interface used to run programs, manage computer files and interact with the computer. Command-line interfaces are also called command-line user interfaces, console user interfaces and character user interfaces.

## Benefits of using CLI

1. **Efficiency and Speed:**
    - CLI commands can execute tasks much faster than navigating through GUIs.
    - For repetitive tasks, scripts can be created to automate processes, saving significant time and effort.

2. **Resource Management:**
    - CLI consumes less system resources, making it ideal for managing remote servers and devices with limited resources. 

3. **Precision and Control:**
    - The CLI provides precise control over the system, allowing users to perform complex tasks with specific options and parameters that might not be available through a GUI.

4. **Automation:**
    - Scripting in the CLI enables the automation of routine tasks. Batch files, shell scripts, and cron jobs can be created to run tasks at specified times or under certain conditions.

## Other Common use cases of CLI

1. **System Administration:**
    - System administrators use the CLI to manage files, install software, configure network settings, and monitor system performance.

2. **Data Processing:**
    - The CLI is used for data manipulation tasks such as sorting, filtering, and transforming data with tools like `awk`, `sed`, and `grep`.

3. **Development:**
    - Developers rely on the CLI for tasks such as compiling code, managing version control, running test suites, and deploying applications.
